/**
 * The consumers module contains a listener for Player events that the PlayerProducer sends to Kafka.
 * <p>
 * 
 * The PlayerConsumer class is not required for the Players microservice to work correctly.
 * Rather, the consumer serves two other purposes:
 * 1. It helps with writing tests for the producer's functionality.
 * 2. It serves as an example on how to configure consumers in Spring Boot applications.
 * <p>
 * 
 * Consumers could be moved under test package, however I feel like they might as well be under main.
 * Who knows, maybe I eventually figure out some actual use case for them.
